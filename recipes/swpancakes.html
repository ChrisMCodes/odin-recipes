    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Swedish pancakes (or pannkaka, pl. pannkakor) are a traditional treat similar to crepes. They are slightly
        thicker than the French version of this treat
        and are generally served with jam and whipped cream. Pannkakor are delicious any time of day, any time of year,
        but are most traditionally eaten on Thursdays
        at lunch time as a sweet treat after a big bowl of pea soup.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recipes and techniques surrounding pannkakor vary, but are always deliciously pan fried. They are most often
        served rolled up, but sometimes they are wedged,
        folded, or even served spread out. Have fun with this recipe and enjoy one of my favorite foods.
